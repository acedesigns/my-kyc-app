## How to contribute

#### **Did you find a bug?**

We welcome your contributions. There are several ways to help out:

* Create an [issue](https://github.com/acedesigns/my-kyc-app/issues) on GitHub, if you have found a bug
* Write test cases for open bug issues
* Write patches for open bug/feature issues, preferably with test cases included
* Contribute to the [documentation](https://github.com/acedesigns/my-kyc-app/docs)

There are a few guidelines that we need contributors to follow so that we have a chance of keeping on top of things.
